== Description

The term "gluecode" refers to a binary that contains the binding specific generated code from the Franca files
"test-derived-types.fidl", "test-interface-proxy.fidl" and "test-predefined-types.fidl" that are delivered in the
src directory within that project. The gluecode library needs to contain the generated proxy and stub files (Common-API as well as binding specific ones) from
the three .fidl files mentioned above.

There are some cmake options that allow you to define the binding that should be tested:

* -DCMAKE_GLUECODE_SOMEIP_NAME=SomeIPGlue and -DSomeIPGlue_DIR : 
    This will enable the verification test for SomeIP in ctest
* -DCMAKE_GLUECODE_DBUS_NAME=DBusGlue and -DDBusGlue_DIR : 
    This will enable the verifcation tests for DBus in ctest

If the gluecode for both middlewarebindings is defined, there will be two 
testcases available for one verification tests. One with postfix `DBus` and one
with `SomeIP`.

Example: Excerpt of a `ctest -N` call inside the build directory, when both middlewares
were specified in the `cmake` call:
----
$ ctest -N
Test project ascgit017.CommonAPI-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.core.verification/build
  [...]
  Test  #6: DTPrimitiveDBus
  Test  #7: DTAdvancedDBus
  Test  #8: DTDerivedDBus
  [...]
  Test #20: DTPrimitiveSomeIP
  Test #21: DTAdvancedSomeIP
  Test #22: DTDerivedSomeIP
  [...]
----

GTest is needed to compile and run the test. Its confuguration script location must be available 
in the environment variable `GTEST_CONFIG`. 

== Usage

1. Build needed glue code libraries, e.g. for SomeIP and for DBus.
   Instructions how to do so can be found in the corresponding READMEs in the 
   verification folders of the middlewares. For example 
   `ascgit017.CommonAPI-SomeIP-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.someip.verification`
   in case of SomeIP.
2. Run `cmake` (see below).
   Ensure you have `GTEST_CONFIG` set to the correct location, 
   e.g. `GTEST_CONFIG=/home/user/work/gtest/scripts/gtest-config`
3. Run `make check` (Ensure that any additional .so, like the patched libdbus, 
   which may be required can be found, for example by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable)
4. Call `ctest -N` in the build directory to list the available test cases.
   Run `ctest -V` (additional .so must be set in LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to run all tests.
   or run `ctest -V -R $TESTCASENAME` to run a single test. 

CMake Example call:
